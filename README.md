<h1>jGrass</h1>
<p>jGrass is a Front End boilerplate that includes the jQuery library, Sass, and Grunt</p>

<p>jGrass is a direct extension and application of Chris Coyier's article <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/">Grunt for People Who Think Things Like Grunt are Weird and Hard</a>.  Be sure to check it out if you are not yet familiar with <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Being a boilerplate, there's not much to it to get started.  Follow these steps in order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Terminal and run this command: <pre>npm install -g grunt-cli</pre></li>
  <li>Then clone this repo: <pre>git clone https://github.com/brianjcarroll/jGrass.git</pre></li>
  <li>Open the repo in your text editor of choice</li>
  <li>Start building!</li>
</ul>
